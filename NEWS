0.1.5
=====
Update to work with Linux 2.6.0-test5.

0.1.4
=====

Update to work with Linux 2.6.0-test2.  Drop support for 2.5 kernels.
Increase maximal allowed memory window.

0.1.3
=====

Split sources for 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.  There is too much difference.
Add support for Linux 2.5.72.  Enable mapping only after latency has
been programmed.  Disallow memory mapping in the first megabyte - it
hangs some Intel machines.

0.1.2
=====

Add missing call to class_device_unregister().  Without it, 2.5.x
kernels would crash randomly after module removal.  Split unaligned I/O
windows in two.  This should fix support for Symbol cards.

0.1.1
=====

Update to the new PCMCIA API in Linux 2.5.68-bk11.  Make sure that the
memory and I/O regions are aligned.  Remove support for padding around
unaligned regions.  

0.1.0
=====

Reset implementation was completely broken.  Fixed now.  Slow down
access to control registers, fast access was unreliable.

0.0.9
=====

Implemented reset.  Added preliminary support for wait states.

0.0.8
=====

Update for the new interrupt API used starting with Linux 2.5.68-bk2.

0.0.7
=====

Added support for 8-bit bus access.  pcnet_cs is working now.

0.0.6
=====

Another fix for pcmcia-cs.  Allocate address areas dynamically.  PLX9052
has only 4 of them, so they should be used on demand.  Memory windows
are supported now, but they haven't been tested.  There are still
problems with pcnet_cs and ide-cs.

0.0.5
=====

Fixed event processing when compiling in pcmcia-cs tree.

0.0.4
=====

Memory windows are now dynamic.  One window is implemented, so it's used
for CIS.  The whole I/O region actually decoded by the socket is now
allocated, not just the requested window.  Module count has been fixed -
the driver cannot be unloaded if it's used by cardmgr.

0.0.3
=====

Unified version for Linux 2.4.x, 2.5.x and pcmcia-cs.  Yes, it looks
ugly, but it's important not to exclude any testers at this point.

0.0.2
=====

I/O windows are now dynamic.  Memory windows still don't work.  Only
wireless cards are known to work.

0.0.1
=====

Initial public version.  Both I/O and memory are static.  Only wireless
cards are known to work.  Memory windows don't work at all.
